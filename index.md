I am a deep learning research scientist at Ultromics, where I teach machines to see the heart in ways even cardiologists might envy. My work involves crafting models that ensure zero variability and fully reproducible echocardiographic view classification. 

I also dabble in multi-task and contrastive learning methods for multi-output tasks, aiming to make cardiac imaging as reliable as my morning coffee.
