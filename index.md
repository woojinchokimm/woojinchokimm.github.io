Hi, I’m Woo-Jin, a research scientist at [Ultromics](https://www.ultromics.com). I’ve had the privilege of working on some of the world's first FDA-cleared AI products that are reshaping cardiovascular screening and diagnostics. From model development to rigorous validation, my work directly contributes to creating tools that help clinicians make faster and more accurate decisions in patient care.

My research expertise lies in self-supervised learning, spanning contrastive methods such as DINOv2 and I-JEPA, as well as reconstructive frameworks like masked autoencoders. I have applied these approaches to both convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures, exploring their potential in pretraining and feature extraction for downstream tasks. Additionally, I have worked on designing and optimizing multi-task models to address the unique challenges of medical AI, including domain-specific data scarcity and interpretability.
