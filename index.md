I'm a deep learning research scientist at [Ultromics](https://www.ultromics.com), where I channel my passion for deep learning into mastering the art of cardiac image interpretation. 

My focus? Ensuring our models are as sharp and consistent as the best cardiologists' eyes, just without the need for coffee breaks. â˜•

I develop and validate models that provide zero variability and ensure fully reproducible outcomes in echocardiographic view classification. 

Alongside my main research initiatives, I am interested in applying multi-task and contrastive learning techniques.
