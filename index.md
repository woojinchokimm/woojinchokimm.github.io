Hi, I’m Woo-Jin, a research scientist at [Ultromics](https://www.ultromics.com). I’ve had the privilege of working on some of the world's first FDA-cleared AI products that are reshaping cardiovascular screening and diagnostics. From model development to rigorous validation, my work directly contributes to creating tools that help clinicians make faster and more accurate decisions in patient care.

My expertise spans transformers, pretraining methods, and uncertainty estimation, with a strong focus on rigorous model testing to ensure reliability and compliance. Recently, my work has extended to reinforcement learning applications for cost-sensitive learning, designing agents that intelligently balance the trade-off between acquisition costs and diagnostic accuracy.
