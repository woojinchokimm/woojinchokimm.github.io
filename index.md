Hi, I’m Woo-Jin, a research scientist at [Ultromics](https://www.ultromics.com). I’ve had the privilege of working on some of the world's first FDA-cleared AI products that are reshaping cardiovascular screening and diagnostics. From model development to rigorous validation, my work directly contributes to creating tools that help clinicians make faster and more accurate decisions in patient care.

On the research side, I’ve delved into fascinating areas like transformers, multi-task models, and CNNs, exploring how these technologies can tackle the unique challenges of medical AI. I love the balance between innovative research and the hands-on development of solutions that make a real-world impact.
