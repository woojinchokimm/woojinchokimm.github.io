I'm a deep learning research scientist at Ultromics, where I channel my passion for deep learning into mastering the art of cardiac image interpretation. In this pursuit, I develop and validate models that provide zero variability and ensure fully reproducible outcomes in echocardiographic view classification. My focus? Ensuring our models are as sharp and consistent as the best cardiologists' eyes, just without the need for coffee breaks.

Alongside my main research initiatives, I am actively involved in applying multi-task and contrastive learning techniques. My expertise, developed through my doctoral thesis, lies in improving the reliability of echocardiographic outcomes by utilizing high-resolution 3D cardiac meshes from CMR.
